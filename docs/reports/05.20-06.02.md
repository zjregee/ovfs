### Overview for 05.20-06.02
Through end-to-end trials and local development, we have verified the potential difficulties of the ovfs project from two aspects, and established a foundation for the subsequent advancement of the project.

The first is the maturity of virtiofs and virtofsd technology. The ease of use of the ovfs project depends largely on this.

The second is the potential problems that may exists when combining virtiofsd original code with the asynchronous ecosystem. In the initial development, when virtiofsd involved tokio and opendal related calls, the process would inexplicably exit. After investigation, this is because virtiofsd prohibits the use of some system calls by enabling secure computing mode by default. After deleting the related code, opendal can be used normally in virtofsd.

In addition, ovfs has completed the initialization pr in the opendal project, and will continue to advance to improve its implementation.

#### Task List
- [x] Run virtiofsd and share local filesystem directory between VMs through virtiofsd.
- [x] Re-implement passthroughfs in virtiofsd through opendal and verify its feasibility.
- [x] Initialize the ovfs project in opendal.

#### Plan For Near Future
Code development for ovfs from these four aspects:
- [ ] Polish code.
- [ ] Align ofs, add configuration parsing and project running entry.
- [ ] Add virtiofs message parsing and forwarding related implementation.
- [ ] Add filesystem functions based on opendal, the goal is to realize file creation and deletion in s3. This mvp mainly involves these functions: lookup, getattr, create, unlink, init, etc.

Potential completion time: 06.16.
