### Overview for Week 2 05.20-05.26

This week, through end-to-end trials and development, we have fully verified the potential difficulties of the ovfs project from two aspects, and established a good foundation for the subsequent advancement of the project.

The first is the maturity of virtiofs and virtofsd technology. The ease of use of the ovfs project depends largely on this. Through actual attempts and experience with qemu and virtiofsd, although there are still some problems in some places, such as the crash of Ubuntu 22.04 installed through qemu (there is no intention to go into this issue at present), etc, overall this set of technical chains is very easy to use.

The second is the potential problems that may exists when combining virtiofsd original code with the asynchronous ecosystem. Since virtofsd does not rely on asynchronous ecosystem construction, the asynchronous interface functions of opendal are handled by explicitly using tokio runtime and synchronous bridging. It is worth mentioning that in the initial development, when virtiofsd involved tokio and opendal related calls, the process would inexplicably exit. After investigation, this is because virtiofsd prohibits the use of some system calls by enabling secure computing mode by default. After deleting the related code, opendal can be used normally in virtofsd.

#### Task List
- [x] Install and run Ubuntu 20.04 via qemu.
- [x] Share local filesystem directory between VMs through virtiofsd.
- [x] Re-implement passthroughfs in virtiofsd through opendal and verify its feasibility.

#### Plan For Near Future
- [ ] Start a PR in opendal, including initializing the ovfs project, implementing the MVP of ovfs based on S3 (supporting file creation and deletion), and deleting a lot of useless code in virtiofsd.
