### Overview for 06.03-06.27
#### Tasks List
- Incorporate ovfs into opendal integrations.
- Continuously polish code and develop features.
- Completed a qemu-kvm-based VMs building, installation and running [script](https://github.com/zjregee/ovfs/blob/main/scripts/install_and_run_vm.sh), which does not require a graphical interface and any interaction, and can be used to build a ci test environment in the future.

#### Plan For Near Future
-[ ] Continue to add filesystem interface support for ovfs, here is the tracking [issue](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/4786).
-[ ] Try to add test ci. Although ovfs currently supports fewer functions, synchronously iterating test scripts and ovfs interface support may be a good way to iterate.

#### About Potential Test Scenarios
Since the integration test of ovfs requires starting a VM in github actions, it is relatively complicated. Currently, a proposed test plan includes the following steps:
- The test environment is built through python scripts. The python scripts need to implement the following:
  - Run the download, build, install and run scripts of VMs to start a VM running the ssh service.
  - After the VM is running, enter the VM through the ssh service to mount a host-side directory into the VM.
- The shared directory exposed to the VM includes a python script for testing, which is run using the VM's built-in python environment (the test script also runs through the ssh service and obtains the test results).
- The python script under test performs some file read and write operations in the shared directory to verify the correctness of the file system interface.

#### About Usage Scenarios And Docker
Through this period of learning, I have a better understanding of virtiofs related technologies. The kvm-based virtualization solution is open source and is the most commonly used virtualization solution. Based on the current implementation of ovfs, we can provide shared file system services for kvm-based VMs, and provide examples of using qemu and libvirt in the usage documentation in the future.

However, no potential integration point has been found for the docker technology that has been discussed before. As far as I know, the file systems currently used by docker only include the main union file system and the local file system directly used by mounting to handle data reading and writing of external volumes. Ofs can provide services directly to docker, but this does not involve docker itself.
